# Student-Finance-Management-Portal-Servicenow

Built on ServiceNow Platform (Hackathon Project – 2025)
## Overview

The Student Finance Management Portal is a unified web-based platform developed on ServiceNow to help students manage, monitor, and optimize their personal finances.
It simplifies budget tracking, expense logging, savings goals, and financial literacy through a user-friendly Service Portal integrated with intelligent automation and analytics.

This project was developed as part of a ServiceNow Hackathon 2025, where the goal was to build an impactful and scalable low-code financial solution for students.

## Problem Statement

Students often struggle to manage their daily expenses, savings, and budgeting habits effectively due to the absence of a unified, automated, and educational financial management system.
Existing tools are either too complex or not tailored for students.
